## You have collected your data - what now?

## Building an Environment for Data Storytelling
1. Project Directory Structure  
  
2. Building of a good spreadsheet  
  
3. More than just data...
  
4. Is this a good spreadsheet?

##  You, After Recording Data
![](./Images/spreadsheets/illuminati-movies-matrix-drone.jpg)

## Why Think About Directory Structure
1. Directory structure organized your brain  
  
2. Easy to find what you need  
  
3. Makes versioning of files easier  
  
4. Provides natural project extensions

## Oh, the horror!

## At least some versioning, but...

## Getting there...

## A Full Workflow for a Huge Project

## How would you structure your environment?

1. Pick a partner.  
\
2. Concoct a made-up data collection adventure.  
\
3. Decide what elements you would want to use to create a good structured environment for your data analysis project.


## A Good Project Structure
<p align="left">
Top Level  
 |  
 |--- Data  
 <div class="fragment" style="text-align:left">|  
 |--- Scripts</div>  
 <div class="fragment" style="text-align:left">|  
 |--- Derived_Data</div>  
 <div class="fragment" style="text-align:left">|  
 |--- Figures</div>  
 <div class="fragment" style="text-align:left">|  
 |--- Reports</div>  
</p>

<div class="fragment"><center>Is this enough?</center></div>

## An alternate structure
![](./Images/spreadsheets/proj_structure.png){width="60%"}
<div class="fragment"><center>What is different here?</center></div>

## This can get very detailed

## Spreadsheets Make the Wold Go 'Round
![](./Images/spreadsheets/1200px-Microsoft_Office_Excel_(2018–present).svg.png)


## Within This Grid Is Power
![](./Images/spreadsheets/maxresdefault.jpg)

## Two Main Styles of Data
- Long: Each row is a single measurement  
     - Many measurements per observation  
     - Multple columns describing specific observation and measurement  
\
\
- Wide: Each row is a complete observation
     - Many measurement types are columns

## Wide and Long Data
![](./Images/spreadsheets/wide_long.png)

## Wide Data
![](./Images/spreadsheets/wide_data.png){width="80%"}

- One Observation per row  
- All data fields are columns

## Long Data
![](./Images/spreadsheets/long_data.png)

- Each measurement 1 row  
- All information about measurement in row

## Hybrid Data
![](./Images/spreadsheets/hybrid_data.png)

- Neither long nor wide
- Each row has multiple measurements…but also some unique qualities
- Each row is not a complete observation 

## Efficiency May Drive Data Sheet Design

## Syncing Data Collection and Entry
![](./Images/spreadsheets/wide_data_sheet.png){width="75%"}
  
<center>Wide or long?</center>



## Good Rules for Data Entry
- Columns should have only 1 type of data  
  
- One thing per cell
  
- No bare space  
  
- Consistent NA character  
   
- See Browman and Woo 2017 for many others

## A note on filenames
- Be descriptive  
  
- Make it machine readable (no spaces)  
  
- Date it

## Initial Workbook Creation

<center>Wide or long or hybrid - your call</center>
<div style="font-size:12pt; position:absolute; left:0; bottom:-100px">Browman and Woo 2017</div>

## Can have multiple sheets with linked columns
![](./Images/spreadsheets/linked_squares.jpg)

<div style="font-size:12pt; position:absolute; left:0; bottom:-100px">Browman and Woo 2017</div>

## Just say no to blank cells
![](./Images/spreadsheets/no_blank_cells.jpg)

- Use NA, -, ., or something else **standard**

<div style="font-size:12pt; position:absolute; left:0; bottom:-100px">Browman and Woo 2017</div>


## Make Variable Names Simple
![](./Images/spreadsheets/variable_names.jpg)
<div style="font-size:12pt; position:absolute; left:0; bottom:-100px">Browman and Woo 2017</div>


## Warning: Dates
![](./Images/spreadsheets/iso_8601.png)  
  
- Use a Standard format  
- But, a Day, Month, and Year column is not a bad idea  
<div style="font-size:12pt; position:absolute; left:0;">https://xkcd.com/1179/</div>

## Do not use highlighting, formulae, etc

<div style="font-size:12pt; position:absolute; left:0; bottom:-100px">Browman and Woo 2017</div>

## Managing Data to Fight Information Entropy

## Metadata
![](./Images/spreadsheets/metadata_wordcloud.png)

## Metadata: Data Reporting
- WHO created the data?
- WHAT is the content of the data?
- WHEN were the data created?
- WHERE is it geographically?
- HOW were the data developed?
- WHY were the data developed?

![](./Images/spreadsheets/data_dictionary.jpg)
<div style="font-size:12pt; position:absolute; left:0; bottom:-100px">Browman and Woo 2017</div>

## A Simply Typology of Metadata
- Numerical
      - Continuous
      - Integers
      - Ordinal
\
- Controlled Vocabulary
      - Certain defined words with defined meanings
      - Has a reference ‘dictionary’

- Dates/Times
      - Many formats – POSIX 

- Raw Text

- Other Media

1. Define, compare, and contrast vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames. Feel free to look at their help files.  
  
2. Install the `dplyr` library. Install the `readxl` library. Install the `readr` library.

3. Load the `readxl` and `readr` libraries. Load the data file from lab using `read.csv` and `read_csv`. Now use `read_excel` to load the excel file you generated in lab. Looking at the three objects you loaded in, what are the any differences or similarities between them? 

4. What does the output of `str`, `summary`, and `visdat::vis_dat` tell you about the data you loaded? What is different or the same?

5. Add a column to the mtcars data called `Model` which uses the rownames of mtcars as its values. Show me the head of the data frame to see if it's been done correctly. Note, to add a column to a data frame, we can specify `yourdf$new_col_name <- new_vector_we_we_are_adding` (note, that's pseudo-code). Note how we are using the `$` notation to add a new column.

6. Let's use the `bind_rows` function in dplyr, as it's pretty powerful. Let's say you want to add a new row to mtcars for a new model. Make a new data frame with the following columns: Model = Fizzywig, mpg=31.415, awesomness=11.  Now try to make a new data frame where you `rbind` `mtcars` and this new data frame. What happens? Then, make a new data frame here you use `dplyr::bind_rows` to combine them. Examine the resulting data frame. What do you see? How do the two methods differ?

<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Final Project</h1>
<h4 class="author">Intro to Data Science for Biology</h4>
<h4 class="date">Presentations May 12, 2023, Paper Due May 17, 2023</h4>

</div>


<p>See past projects <a href="./past_projects.html">here</a></p>
<div id="submission-links" class="section level1">
<h1>Submission links</h1>
<p>Submit links to projects the day before due to <a
href="mailto:jarrett.byrnes@umb.edu">professor</a><br />
Submit paper to usual dropbox link</p>
</div>
<div id="putting-it-all-together" class="section level1">
<h1>Putting it all together</h1>
<p>For your final project, Iâ€™m asking you to create an exploration of a
dataset of your choice. This project should provide people with ways to
explore the dataset in a way that will guide them towards learning
something about relationships and patterns in the data. The final
project will have two graded parts - a Shiny app for end-users and a
final paper where you tell us just what you did. Your app and paper
should explore two or more particular features of the data you find
interesting, and provide an end-user a way to derive new and meaningful
inferences from the data within the bounds of the controls you provide
them with.</p>
<div id="the-shiny-app" class="section level2">
<h2>The Shiny App</h2>
<p>Your app should present 1) the dataset you are looking at, and a full
explanation of what it is (this can be a front page, a tabset, or
whatever you would like), 2) provide users at least 3 ways to explore
different aspects of the data, 3) provide model fits and statistical
tests where it would help the user, 4) useful visual representations
that are easy for the user to understand. It should be organized in a
way that a user has no problem navigating around, and should not just be
one giant pane of overwhelming data and analyses.</p>
<p>You will present the app to both your classmates and visitors in a
presentation Zoom session. There, I will set you each up with your own
breakout room where people can visit you and talk to you about the app.
You will have a running app on <a href="http://shinyapps.io"
class="uri">http://shinyapps.io</a> (or other server) to which you can
give them a link. Half of the class will present for the first
half-hour, the other half for the second half-hour, so you can visit
each others projects!</p>
<p>In addition to your professor and TA visiting you and trying out your
app, you will be required to submit the code and data for the app as a
zipped up archive. Note - You might want to use the
<code>goodpractices</code> library and the <code>styler</code> library
to make sure your code is readable and accords to good style-guide
principles. You will submit this as you usually submit homeworks.</p>
<div id="grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>For your app and presentation, you will be graded on 1. Ease of
use<br />
2. Interpretability of what a user learns from the app<br />
3. Thorough exploration of the data<br />
4. Quality of visualizations<br />
5. Validity of analyses<br />
6. Quality and readbility of code<br />
7. Presentation of app to an end-user<br />
8. Ability to answer questions about the data and results<br />
<br />
Extra credit is available to those who want to publicize their app more
widely.<br />
Each of the above will be graded on a 5 point scale.<br />
1 = Student shows little ability to execute this concept.<br />
2 = Student shows a flawed attempt at execution of this step, or minimal
effort.<br />
3 = Student shows understanding of the concept, and is able to achieve a
minimal satisfactory outcome.<br />
4 = Student shows understanding, and presents a well-crafted execution
of the concept.<br />
5 = Student has achieved mastery of the concept, with a deep and
compelling execution.</p>

<div id="the-paper" class="section level2">
<h2>The Paper</h2>
<div id="organizational-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Organizational Structure</h3>
<p>The final paper should be broken up into something along the lines of
the following sections. You may feel free to adapt this flexibly given
your unique data set and set of problems and questions. But this is a
general guide, particularly if you are lost.</p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level4">
<h4>1) Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is the dataset you are using?
<ul>
<li>Describe the dataset in detail</li>
<li>Visualize summary information about the data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Based on the data, what types of elements did you want people to be
able to explore? What questions did you want them to be able to ask and
answer?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level4">
<h4>2) Methods</h4>
<ul>
<li>How did you prepare and manupulate the data to get it ready for your
app? Write out the workflow(s) step by step.</li>
<li>How did you decide on the ways you wanted the end-user to be able to
explore the data? What information did you chose to give to them and
why? What choices did you give them and why?</li>
<li>What was the setup of your app? Tell us about the layout you chose,
why you chose it, and how it created a</li>
<li>What are the visualizations and analyses that you provided access
to?
<ul>
<li>Show us the types of visualizations you wanted to create to help the
data tell its story<br />
</li>
<li>What are the underlying models you let the user fit? Why those
models? What is their data generating process and your error generating
process?</li>
<li>What statistical tests did you return to the user. Why? What did
they tell them?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Include a working link to your app</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3>3) Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the most obvious things that you can learn from your app
about your dataset?
<ul>
<li>Based on what people could do in your app, is there any 2-3
visualizations or analyses that stand out? Show them here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are other visualizations and analyses that come out of your
dataset?
<ul>
<li>Anything that your app made you think you should go look at?</li>
<li>Any statistical tests of patterns that you can see in your app, but
are not formally tested there?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>4) Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>What did you learn from your app and your exploration of this
data?</li>
<li>Does the way you setup your app allow you to learn anything you did
not expect?</li>
<li>What feedback did you get about your app?</li>
<li>Do your results suggest additional visualizations/analyses? Feel
free to conduct them here.</li>
<li>What final conclusion can you draw about your data set?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="some-markdown-notes-for-the-paper" class="section level3">
<h3>Some Markdown Notes for the paper</h3>
<p>As a quick note, you might want to massage you <a
href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html">code chunks</a> a bit
in your presentation so we donâ€™t see code, error messages, warnings,
etc. Remember <code>warning=FALSE</code>, <code>message=FALSE</code>,
<code>echo=FALSE</code>, and more are all your friends. For more -
including how to resize graphs and such - see <a
href="https://yihui.name/knitr/options/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to output your statistical results as a table, use <a
href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html">knitr::kable</a> or
<a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html">kabelExtra</a>.
If you want to build tables that you fill in with text, I recommend this
<a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables">markdown table
generator</a> as <a
href="http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/tables.html">markdown
tables</a> can be tricky.<br />
<br />
You might want to use the <code>goodpractices</code> library and the
<code>styler</code> library to make sure your code is readable and
accords to good style-guide principles.</p>
<p>Last, hereâ€™s a <a
href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown
cheatsheet</a> - although Rstudioâ€™s help has a good set of materials as
well.</p>
<div id="grading-of-the-paper" class="section level4">
<h4>Grading of the Paper</h4>
<p>Remember, Iâ€™m looking for quality well commented, well thought-out,
well styled code in addition to gorgeous visualizations that convery a
message and unambiguous analyses (where possible). As a guide to the
whole paper, hereâ€™s my rubric. Once you finish your paper, assess
yourself. Heck, if you even want to write a short section where you
assess yourself against this rubric and justify why we should give you a
certain grade according to this rubric, feel free!</p>
